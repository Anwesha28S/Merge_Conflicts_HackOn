## 🌐 Overview

**Amazon Now** is a full-stack AI-powered conversational commerce platform where every shopping journey is driven by **Aria** — an intelligent AI shopping companion. Combining **natural language understanding**, **real-time contextual intelligence**, **game-theory price negotiation**, and **collaborative group shopping**, Amazon Now transforms everyday e-commerce into a seamless, intuitive, and deeply personalized experience.

Built by **Team Merge_Conflicts** for the **Hack On Amazon Season 6, 2026**, Amazon Now demonstrates how conversational AI, semantic search, and contextual awareness can redefine how users discover, evaluate, and purchase products.

> **💡 Key Insight:** Users spend **60% of their shopping time** scrolling through search results. Amazon Now replaces keyword searches with natural conversations — *"I'm hosting a party tonight, what should I get?"* — and delivers curated, budget-aware, contextually relevant product bundles instantly.

---

## 🚨 The Problem

<div align="center">

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 🔍 **Keyword-based search** | Users type generic queries, scroll endlessly through irrelevant results |
| 💰 **No price negotiation** | Fixed prices with no room for dynamic, personalized deals |
| 🛒 **Shopping in isolation** | Families and roommates can't plan and shop together in real-time |
| 🌧️ **No real-world context** | Recommendations ignore weather, time, mood, events, and festivals |
| 🤒 **No situational awareness** | Stores don't detect when a user is sick, celebrating, or stressed |
| 🍽️ **Recipe friction** | Users manually search for each ingredient when cooking a recipe |
| 📋 **No meal planning** | No way to generate a weekly meal plan and auto-create a grocery list |

</div>

**Data Flow:**
1. **User speaks or types** a natural language request to Aria
2. **Agent Service** classifies intent → purchase, bargain, recipe, emotion, or browse
3. **RAG Service** retrieves semantically relevant products from ChromaDB / fallback search
4. **Context Service** injects live weather, time-of-day, and event signals (IPL, festivals, weekends)
5. **LLM Service** generates structured JSON with curated recommendations (anti-hallucination via RAG context)
6. **Taxonomy Service** organizes results into Amazon-style departments for display
7. **Frontend** renders interactive product cards with voice response via Web Speech API

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Aria AI Shopping Assistant (`/chat`)
- **Natural language shopping** — talk to Aria like a personal shopper instead of typing keywords
- Powered by Groq's **Llama 3.1 8B Instant** LLM with automatic fallback to **Gemma2 9B IT** on rate limits
- **RAG pipeline** with ChromaDB vector search + Python fuzzy fallback for anti-hallucination
- Amazon-style **department taxonomy** grouping (8 departments, 22+ sub-categories)
- **Budget-aware** recommendations with real-time slider ceiling enforcement
- **Follow-up conversation detection** — short clarifying questions won't trigger redundant product searches
- **Quick reply buttons** for voice-optimized interactions

### 🎙️ Voice Commerce
- **Hands-free shopping** using browser-native Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition` + `speechSynthesis`)
- Speak requests, hear responses — fully conversational loop
- Interim transcript display while speaking
- Graceful degradation on unsupported browsers (mic button hidden)

> **Note:** Voice features require HTTPS. The live deployment on Vercel provides this automatically.

### 🤒 Emotional & Situational Intelligence
Amazon Now detects **8 distinct emotional or situational contexts** from messages and assembles a complete, scenario-aware **Care Kit** of products:

| Situation | Trigger Examples | Kit Name |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| 🤒 Sick | "I have a fever", "sore throat" | Recovery Care Kit |
| 🎉 Celebrating | "It's my birthday", "got the job" | Celebration Bundle |
| 🫶 Stressed | "bad day", "burnt out" | Comfort & Unwind Kit |
| 🥗 Dieting | "craving something healthy" | Guilt-Free Craving Kit |
| 💪 Workout | "post-workout", "gym day" | Fuel & Recover Kit |
| 📚 Studying | "pulling an all-nighter" | Study Fuel Kit |
| 🥴 Hungover | "drank too much last night" | Morning-After Kit |
| 😴 Lazy | "can't cook tonight" | Zero-Effort Meal Kit |

Each Care Kit respects the user's dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, high-protein, weight-loss) and budget constraints.

### 💬 AI-Powered Smart Bargaining
A first-of-its-kind **Stackelberg game theory negotiation engine** that lets users haggle with Aria for better prices:

| Offer Range | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| ≥ 95% of list price | ✅ Accepted with round-off discount |
| 90–95% of list | Counter at 8% discount |
| Above cost + margin floor | Counter with product swap or bundle add-on |
| Below cost floor | Politely decline, offer cheapest alternative |

Loyal customers get up to **12% additional flexibility** based on their purchase history.

### 🤝 Collaborative Group Carts (`/group`)
Shop together with family, roommates, or friends through synchronized group carts:

```
① Create a Group → generates a unique shareable code
② Share the Code → anyone with the code can join the session
③ Add Items → each member can propose products to the shared cart
④ Vote → members upvote or downvote proposed items
⑤ Checkout → the group owner pushes all approved items into their personal cart
```

Dietary preferences of all members (vegetarian, vegan) are tracked for consensus-aware recommendations.

### 🍽️ AI Meal Planner (`/meal-plan`)
Generate a personalized **multi-day meal plan** (1–7 days) with automatic grocery list generation:

```
User specifies goal → LLM generates structured meal plan → 
  Every ingredient mapped to real products → 
    Quantities deduplicated & scaled → 
      Single optimized shopping list → 
        One-click "Add All to Cart"
```

- Respects dietary constraints: vegetarian, vegan, high-protein, weight-loss modes
- Pantry staples (salt, oil, spices) are not over-counted
- Stable IDs per meal for client-side toggle/removal

### 🧾 Recipe-to-Cart Conversion
Paste any recipe text, and Aria instantly:
1. Parses it into a structured ingredient list using the LLM
2. Matches each ingredient to a real product in the catalog
3. Skips items the user recently purchased (deduplication via order history)
4. Presents the matched products with one-click "Add All to Cart"

### 🔍 Semantic Product Discovery
ChromaDB-powered vector search with Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) understands meaning and intent, delivering highly relevant recommendations beyond traditional keyword matching. Falls back to a lightweight **Python-based fuzzy search** with intent-to-category mapping on resource-constrained environments.

### 🔄 Intelligent Product Substitution
When a product is out of stock, the system:
1. Searches for in-stock alternatives using semantic similarity
2. Matches by tag overlap, price proximity, rating, and category
3. **Weight-loss mode** shifts substitutions toward healthier alternatives (e.g., full-cream milk → toned milk, fried → air-fried)
4. Clearly labels substitutions with the original product name and the reason for the swap

### 🌤️ Context-Aware Recommendations
The **Context Service** injects three layers of real-world intelligence into every recommendation:

**1. Live Weather** (via WeatherAPI.com)
| Condition | Recommendations |
|-----------|----------------|
| 🌧️ Rain | Hot snacks, chai, maggi noodles, soup |
| 🥵 Hot (35°C+) | Cold drinks, ice cream, watermelon, buttermilk |
| 🥶 Cold (≤15°C) | Coffee, tea, hot chocolate, soups |
| ☀️ Warm | Refreshing beverages, fruits, salads |

**2. Time of Day**
| Time Window | Product Focus |
|-------------|--------------|
| Morning (7–10) | Eggs, milk, bread, coffee, cereal |
| Afternoon (1–4) | Snacks, cold drinks, fruits |
| Evening (4–7) | Tea-time items, cookies, pakoda |
| Night (9+) | Comfort food, ice cream, instant noodles |

**3. Event Detection**
| Event | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| 🏏 IPL Season | March–May evenings → party snacks, chips, cold drinks |
| 🎉 Weekend | Saturday/Sunday → family groceries, party supplies |
| 🎊 Friday Evening | Party food and celebration snacks |
| 🪔 Festival Season | Oct–Nov → sweets, dry fruits, gift packs |

### 💰 Cart Optimization Engine
Proactively monitors the user's cart value against business thresholds:

| Threshold | Amount | Benefit |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Free Delivery | ₹399 | Save ₹49 delivery charge |
| Coupon Discount | ₹499 | Get ₹75 off |

When the cart is within ₹150 of a threshold, Aria suggests specific products from the user's **frequently purchased items** to cross it — maximizing savings automatically.

### 🍷 Smart Pairing Engine (Graph-Traversal BFS)
A **directed weighted graph** models "frequently bought together" relationships across the entire catalog:

- **Nodes** = product IDs
- **Edges** = complementary purchase probability (weight 0–1)
- **Algorithm** = Priority-queue Best-First Search (BFS) up to depth 2

Examples of built-in pairing edges:
| Source | Target | Weight |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Nachos | Condiments | 0.95 |
| Coffee | Dairy | 0.93 |
| Smartphones | Mobile Accessories | 0.95 |
| Mascara | Eyeliner | 0.90 |
| Women's Dresses | Heels | 0.85 |

Results are grouped into visual clusters like **"Snack Party Bundle 🍿"**, **"Tech Ecosystem Bundle 📱"**, or **"Beauty Routine Bundle 💄"**.

### 📊 Amazon-Style Department Taxonomy
All **194+ products** are organized into **8 top-level Amazon India departments** with tier-2 sub-categories:

| Department | Sub-categories |
|-----------|---------------|
| 📦 Grocery & Gourmet Foods | Grocery & Gourmet |
| 📦 Home & Kitchen | Furniture, Home Décor, Kitchen Tools |
| 📦 Electronics & Accessories | Smartphones, Laptops, Tablets, Mobile Accessories |
| 📦 Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry | Men's Shirts, Men's Shoes, Women's Dresses, Bags, Jewellery, Tops, Sunglasses |
| 📦 Beauty & Personal Care | Makeup & Beauty, Skin Care, Fragrances |
| 📦 Watches & Accessories | Men's Watches, Women's Watches |
| 📦 Sports, Fitness & Outdoors | Sports & Fitness Accessories |

### 🛍️ Full E-Commerce Flow
Amazon Now includes a complete end-to-end shopping infrastructure:

- **User Authentication** — JWT-based registration and login with bcrypt password hashing
- **Product Catalog** — Browsable product grid with category filters, search, and sorting
- **Shopping Cart** — Add, remove, update quantities, clear cart
- **Saved Addresses** — CRUD with default address selection (full Indian address format: line1, line2, city, state, pincode)
- **Payment Methods** — Card, UPI, Cash on Delivery, Net Banking, Wallet (demo/mock — no real card data stored)
- **Order Management** — Place orders, view order history, track payment status (pending → paid → completed)
- **User Profiles** — Dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, high-protein, weight-loss mode), budget preference, favorite categories
- **Conversational Checkout** — Say "buy this" to Aria and she'll collect address + payment via chat, then redirect to payment portal

### Agent Service — The Brain

The `agent_service.py` is the **single entry point** for all chat interactions. It acts as an orchestrator that classifies user intent and routes to the appropriate sub-system:

### LLM Model Fallback Chain

```
Primary: llama-3.1-8b-instant ──[429 / rate limit]──▶ Fallback: gemma2-9b-it
```

Both models use the same `_chat_complete` wrapper that catches `RateLimitError` and transparently retries with the fallback model. Users never see an error.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Installation |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Node.js** | ≥ 18 LTS | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| **Python** | ≥ 3.10 | [python.org](https://python.org) |
| **pip** | Latest | Comes with Python |
| **Docker** | Latest | [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/) *(optional — for containerized setup)* |
| **Groq API Key** | — | Free at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) |

---

### Option A: Docker Compose (Recommended)

The fastest way to get everything running:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Aniruddha1406/India_Innovates_Merge_Conflicts.git
cd India_Innovates_Merge_Conflicts

# 2. Configure environment variables
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env and add your GROQ_API_KEY

# 3. Build the frontend (required for Docker)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# 4. Launch everything
docker-compose up --build
```

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Frontend** | [http://localhost](http://localhost) | Amazon Now web application |
| **Backend API** | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) | FastAPI backend |
| **API Docs** | [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs) | Interactive Swagger UI |

---

### Option B: Manual Setup (Development)

#### Step 1 — Backend

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env → add GROQ_API_KEY

# Start the backend server
uvicorn main:app --port 8000 --reload
```

Backend runs on: `http://localhost:8000`
API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

#### Step 2 — Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:5173`

> ⚠️ If `npm install` fails with peer dependency errors, use `npm install --force`

---

### Step 3 — Generate Product Catalog (Optional)

The repo ships with a pre-built `products.json`. To regenerate from DummyJSON:

```bash
cd backend
python generate_catalog.py
```

This fetches 194+ real products with images from DummyJSON, converts USD prices to INR, and writes `data/products.json`.

## 🧠 AI Signal Control Logic

### Recommendation Pipeline

The LLM service runs a multi-stage pipeline for every new product search:

```
1. Follow-up Detection
   ├── Pure acknowledgement ("thanks", "ok") → No products
   ├── Short question about previous product → Conversational reply
   └── Any search signal detected → Full recommendation pipeline ↓

2. RAG Retrieval
   ├── Resolve vague "more" queries → Extract topic from history
   ├── Blend favorite categories for generic requests
   ├── ChromaDB semantic search (or Python fuzzy fallback)
   └── Intelligent product substitution for out-of-stock items

3. Budget Enforcement
   ├── Adaptive budget: lifts ceiling if browsing expensive categories
   ├── Per-item budget filter (defense-in-depth)
   └── Cumulative budget cap in LLM system prompt

4. LLM Generation
   ├── Injected <RETRIEVED_CATALOG_CONTEXT> for anti-hallucination
   ├── Structured JSON output (message + departments + recommendations)
   └── Auto-fallback to gemma2-9b-it on rate limit

5. Post-LLM Enrichment
   ├── Verify every ID against real product catalog
   ├── Backfill grid if LLM returned fewer items than target
   ├── Server-side Amazon department taxonomy grouping
   └── Cart optimization suggestions attached
```

### Bargaining Decision Tree

```
Buyer Offer
    │
    ├── ≥ List Price ──────────────────▶ ✅ ACCEPT (full price)
    │
    ├── ≥ 95% of List ─────────────────▶ ✅ ACCEPT (round-off discount)
    │
    ├── ≥ 90% of List ─────────────────▶ 🔄 COUNTER (8% discount)
    │
    ├── ≥ Effective Floor ─────────────▶ 🔄 COUNTER (swap / add-on / floor)
    │   ├── Cheaper swap available? ────▶ Swap product + bundle deal
    │   ├── High-margin add-on found? ──▶ Bundle add-on to recover margin
    │   └── No swap/addon ─────────────▶ Counter at effective floor
    │
    └── < Cost Floor ──────────────────▶ ❌ DECLINE (show floor + alternatives)
```

### Deploying the Backend (AWS)

```bash
# Package for deployment
git archive -o amazon-now.zip HEAD backend docker-compose.yml

# Upload to AWS Elastic Beanstalk Docker Environment
# Configure environment variables:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Deploying the Frontend (Vercel)

Deploy the `frontend` folder directly through Vercel:
1. Set root directory to `frontend`
2. The serverless proxy at `api/proxy.js` automatically bridges HTTPS → HTTP
3. Vercel provides automatic HTTPS, global CDN, and zero-downtime deployments

## 👤 How to Use Amazon Now (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Create Your Account
Open the app and click **Create Account**. Enter your username, email, and password. You are automatically logged in and redirected to Aria.

### 2. Set Your Preferences
Click on the **Account** tab. Set your dietary preferences (Vegetarian, Vegan, High-Protein, or Weight-Loss mode), budget preference, and favorite product categories.

### 3. Start Shopping with Aria
Type or speak to Aria naturally:
- *"Show me snacks under ₹100"*
- *"I need ingredients for butter chicken"*
- *"What should I buy for a rainy evening?"*

Click the **+** button on any product card to add it to your cart.

### 4. Try Voice Shopping
Click the **microphone icon** in the chat, speak your request naturally, and Aria responds with product suggestions. The response is also spoken back to you.

### 5. Negotiate a Better Price
Try saying *"Can you do this for ₹400?"* or *"Any discount on this?"* — Aria will accept, counter-offer, or politely decline based on fair pricing logic.

### 6. Plan Your Meals
Go to the **Meal Planner** tab. Choose your goal, select the number of days (1–7) and servings. Click **Add All to Cart** to instantly add all the required groceries.

### 7. Shop with Friends (Group Cart)
Go to the **Group Cart** tab, create a group, and share the code. Everyone can add products and vote on items. The group owner checks out the agreed items.

### 8. Checkout & Pay
Say *"buy this"* or *"checkout"* to Aria — she will guide you through address and payment selection. Choose Card, UPI, COD, Net Banking, or Wallet and complete your order.

### 9. Track Your Orders
Go to the **Orders** tab to view your complete order history with itemized breakdowns, delivery charges, and payment status.

## 📈 Innovation Highlights

### 🎯 Conversational Commerce
Move beyond keyword search into fully natural shopping conversations. Aria understands *"I'm hosting a dinner party for 6"* and recommends a complete set of ingredients, snacks, and beverages — something a search bar could never do.

### 🧠 Contextual Intelligence
Recommendations adapt dynamically based on weather, time, festivals, IPL cricket season, weekends, and the user's emotional state. No two sessions produce the same results.

### 🎲 Game-Theory Bargaining
The Stackelberg negotiation model considers category margins, cost floors, buyer loyalty, and product alternatives to create a fair and engaging haggling experience that feels genuinely human.

### 👥 Collaborative Commerce
Group Carts enable families and roommates to plan and shop together with voting, consensus building, and shared dietary preference tracking — a feature absent from every major e-commerce platform.

### 🔬 Graph-Based Product Discovery
The BFS pairing engine discovers non-obvious product relationships (Nachos → Salsa, Yoga Mat → Protein Shake) that traditional collaborative filtering or vector similarity would miss entirely.

### 🤒 Emotional Intelligence
The Care Kit system detects 8 distinct emotional/situational states from natural language and assembles personalized product bundles — bringing genuine empathy to e-commerce.

### 🍽️ AI-Powered Meal Planning
Full meal plan generation with cross-meal ingredient deduplication and automatic scaling — converting a week's worth of recipes into a single optimized shopping list with one click.
